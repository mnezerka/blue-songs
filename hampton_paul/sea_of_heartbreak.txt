Intro

[G]The lights..in  the [Em]harbor [C]
Don't..shine for [D]me
[G]I'm like a [Em]lost ship[C]
adrift on the [D]sea

{soc}
Sea of [G]Heartbreak lost love and [D]loneliness
Mem'ries of yo[G]ur caress, 
So divine..[C]How I wish that you were mine a-[G]gain my dear
I'm on the [D]sea of tears.......Sea of He[G]artbreak
{eoc}

How did I lose you.
Oh where did I fail 
Why did you leave me
always to sail

Bridge:
[C]Oh what I'd give to [G]sail back to shore 
[C]Back to your arms once [B7/E]more
 
Come to my rescue
Come here to me
Take me and keep me
away from the sea
