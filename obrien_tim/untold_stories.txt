[D]All those untold stories
All those silent [G]lies
[A]We'll never know each ot[D]her
[A]Keepin' them [D]deep inside (let's)
[D]Wash away the troubles
Keepin' us [G]apart
[A]Tell those untold sto[D]ries
[A]Let the [D]healin' start
{end_of_chorus}

[G]It's been so [D]long ago
[G]We went our [D]separate ways
[G]Now maybe [D]time has changed us
[A]And worn the [D]hurt away

You look the same as ever
I'm glad you're here with me
Take a look into my eyes
And tell me what you see


Now, I don't want forgiveness
Honey, I don't need you now
We've built a wall between us
It's time to tear it down

Let's plant a tree together
Maybe we can make it grow
If not now then maybe never
We might not ever know (about)
