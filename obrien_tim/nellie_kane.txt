{title: Nellie Kane}

[C]As a young man I went riding out on the western plain
In the state of North Dokota I met my Nellie [Am]Kane
I [G]met my Nellie [C]Kane
She was [C]living in a lonely cabin with a son by another man
[C]Five years she had waited for him
As long as a woman [Am]can, as [G]long as a woman [C]can

{start_of_chorus}
I don't [F]know what changed my [C]mind
'Til then I [G]was the ramblin [C]kind
The kind of [F]love I can't [C]explain
That I [G]have for Nellie [C]Kane
{end_of_chorus}

Well she took me on to work that day, to help her till the land
In the afternoon we planted seeds
In the evening we held hands, in the evening we held hands
Her blue eyes told me everything a man could want to know
And it was then I realized that I would never go, I would never go

Now many years have gone by, her son has grown up tall
I became a father to him and she became my all, she became my all
