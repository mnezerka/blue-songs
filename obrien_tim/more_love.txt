{title: More Love}
{artist: Tim O'Brian & Darell Scott}

I'm so [C]close to you [G]baby
But I'm [C]so far a[G]way
There's a [C]silence be[G]tween us
And there's [D]so much to say
You're my [C]strength, you're my we[A]akness
You're my f[C]aith, you're my d[G]oubt
We gotta [C]meet in the [G]middle
To [D]work this thing out

{soc}
More [C]love, I can [D]hear our hearts [G]cryin'
More [C]love, I know [D]that's all we [G]need
More [C]love, to [Hm]flow in betw[Em]een us
To [Hm]take us and [Em]hold us and lift us a-b[A7]ove
If there's [C]ever an answer[D]er
It's more lo[C]ve[G]
{eoc}

We're afraid to be idle
So we fill up the days
We run on the treadmill
Keep slavin' away
'Til there's no time for talkin'
About trouble in mind
And the doors are all closed
Between your heart and mine

Just look out a-round us
People fightin' their wars
They think they'll be happy
When they've settled their scores
Let's lay down our weapons
That hold us a-part
Be still for just a minute
Try to open our hearts
