{title: Hold To A Dream}

[G  D  C  D]
[D  G  C  D]

[G]I'm happy to roam, I can find my way through the [D]mountains
To the [C]ocean [D]foam  [G  D  C  D]
But if I had a map to show me the way to your [G]heart dear
I'd [C]follow it [D]home  [D  G  C  D]

Makin' my way through the dimlit streets to the old town
Nowhere to go
Wonder if the scene runnin' in my head will ever slow down
I miss you so

{start_of_chorus}
[Em]Hold [D]to a [C]dream, [Am]carry it [G]up and down
[Em]Fol[D]low a [C]star, [Am]search the [G]world around
[Em]Hold [D]to a [C]dream, [Am]carry it [G]close to me
[G]I'm frozen in time, you alone can set me [D]free

The rain outside is beatin' down, I'm here at home
All alone
We used to stay so warm inside, now a night like this
It chills my bones

I miss you darlin', more and more I'm thinkin'
Thinkin' of you
Late at night lyin' in my sleep I'm dreamin'
Dreamin' of you
