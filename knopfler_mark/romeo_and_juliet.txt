[F][C][B][C]
[F][C][B][C]

[F]A lovestruck Romeo[C][Dm] sings the streets a serenade[C][F]
Laying everybody low[C][Dm] with a love song [B]that he made
[C]Finds a street light[B] [C]steps out into the [F]shade
Says something like [B]you and me babe, how [C]about it?   

Juliet says hey it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack
He's underneath the window, she's singing hey la my boyfriends back
you shouldn't come around here singing up to people like that
Anyway, what you gonna do about it?

{start_of_chorus}
Juli[F]et [C]the dice was [Dm]loaded from [C]the [B]start
And [C]I [F]bet, [C]and you exp[Dm]loded in [C]my [B]heart.
And [C]I for[F]get, I [C]for[Dm]get, the [Dm]movie song
[Gm]When you gonna realize it was just that the time [C]was [Dm]wrong  [C]Juli[F]et?

Come up on different streets, they both the streets of shame
Both dirty both mean, yes and even and dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real.
How can you look at me as if I was just another part of your deal

Well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold.
you can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin yeah
Now you just say oh Romeo yeah, I used to have a scene with him.

{start_of_chorus}
Juliet when we made love you used to cry
you said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?
{end_of_chorus}

I can't do the talk, like they talk on the tv
I can't do a love song, like the way it's meant to be.
I can't do anything, but I'd do anything for you.
I cant't do anything but be in love with you.

And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat and bad company.
All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet I'd do the stars with you anytime.

A love struck Romeo, sings the streets a serenade.
Now he's laying everymody low, with a love song that he made.
Finds a convenient street light, steps out of the shade
Says something like you and me babe how about it

outro:
Bb C  (as long as the lead player can do those tasty fills)

p.s. A second guitarist playing in first position really fills this song out if you are not doing it with a full band.
