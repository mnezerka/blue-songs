{title: Calm After The Storm}
{subtitle: Common Limmets}

[G]Driving in a fast lane
Counting [Em]mile marker signs
[C]The empty seat beside me
[G]Keeps you on my mind

Living in a heartache
Was never something I pursued
I can't keep on chasing
What I can be for you

{soc}
[G]Ooooh skies are black[Em] and blue
Thinking ab[C]out you
Here in the[G] calm after the storm
{eoc}

Tears on a highway
Water in my eyes
This rain ain't gonna change us
So what's the use to cry

I can say I'm sorry
But I don't wanna lie
I just wanna know if staying
Is better than goodbye

{soc}
Ooooh skies are black and blue
Thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm
Ooooh after all that we've been through
There ain't nothin' new
Here in the calm after the storm
{eoc}

Maybe I can find you
Down this broken line
Maybe you can find me
I guess we'll know in time

{soc}
Ooooh skies are black and blue
Thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm
There ain't nothin new
Here in the calm after the storm
{eoc}
