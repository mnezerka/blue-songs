{title: Calm After The Storm}
{subtitle: Common Limmets}

[G]Driving in a fast lane
Counting [Em]mile marker signs
[C]The empty seat beside me
[G]Keeps you on my mind
[G]Living in a heartache
Was never [Em]something I pursued
[C]I can't keep on chasing
[G]What I can be for you

{soc}
[G]Ooooh skies are black[Em] and blue
Thinking ab[C]out you
Here in the[G] calm after the storm
{eoc}

Tears on a highway
Water in my eyes
This rain ain't gonna change us
So what's the use to cry
I can say I'm sorry
But I don't wanna lie
I just wanna know if staying
Is better than goodbye

{soc}
[G]Ooooh skies are black [Em]and blue
Thinking ab[C]out you
Here in the[G] calm after the storm
[G]Ooooh after all that we[Em]'ve been through
There ain't not[C]hin' new
Here in the[G] calm after the storm
{eoc}

[G]Maybe I can find you
[Em]Down this broken line
[C]Maybe you can find me
[G]I guess we'll know in time

[G]Ooooh skies are black [Em]and blue
Thinking ab[C}out you
Here in the[G} calm after the storm
There ain't noth[C}in new
Here in the[G} calm after the storm
