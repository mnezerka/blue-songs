It was in the spring one sunny day
My good gal left me, lord, she went away

{start_of_chorus}
And now she’s gone and I don’t worry
‘Cause I’m sittin’ on top of the world
{end_of_chorus}

She called me up from down in El Paso
Said, “come back daddy, lord I need you so”

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Show me a woman that a man can trust

Mississippi River, long, deep and wide
The woman I’m lovin’ is on the other side

You don’t like my peaches, don’t you shake my tree
Get out of my orchard, let my peaches be

Don’t you come here runnin’, pokin’ out your hand
I’ll get me a woman like you got your man
