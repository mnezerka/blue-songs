{title: Darling Corey}

Wake up wake up darling Corey
Tell me what makes you sleep so sound
The highway robbers are coming
They're ringing around your town

{start_of_chorus}
[A]Dig a hole dig a hole in the meadow
Dig a hole in the cold cold ground
Dig a hole dig a hole in the [G]meadow
Gonna [A]lay darling [E]Corey [A]down
{end_of_chorus}

Go away go away darling Corey
Quit hanging around my bed
Pretty women gonna run me distracted
Corn liquor is killing me dead

Well the first time I seen darling Corey
She was standing in the door
She had her shoes and stocking in her hands
And her little feet on the floor

Well the next time I seen darling Corey
She was sitting on the banks of the sea
Had a forty-four wrapped around her body
And a banjo on her knee

Oh the last time I saw my Corey
She had a wine glass in her hand
She was drinking that sweet liquor
With a low-down gambing man

Can't you hear those bluebirds a singing
Don't you hear that mournful sound
They're preaching darling Corey's funeral
In some lonesome graveyard ground
