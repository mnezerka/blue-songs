[G]All the good times are [C]past and [G]gone
All the good times are [D]o'er
[G]All the good times are [C]past and [G]gone
Little darling don't [D]weep no [G]more
{end_of_chorus}

I wish to the Lord I'd never been born
Or died when I was young
I'd never have seen your sparkling blue eyes
Or heard your liyn' tongue

Oh don't you see that passenger train
A-comming around the bend
It's taking me away from this lonesome old town
To never return again

Come back, come back my own true love
And stay a while with me
If ever I've had a friend in this world
You've been a friend to me

Oh don't you see that lonesome dove
A-flying from pine to pine
He's mourning for his own true love
Just like I mourn for mine
