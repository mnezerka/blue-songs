{title: My Sweet Love Ain't Around}
{subtitle: Written and recorded by Hank Wiliams Sr.}

[D]Listen to the rain a-fallin'
Can't you hear that lonesome sound[A7]
Oh, my [G] poor old heart is [D] breakin'
'Cause my sweet [A7]love ain't a[D]round.

Lord, I think I'll start to ramble
Got to leave this weary town
This old place is way too lonely
'Cause my sweet love ain't around.

On that train tonight I'm leavin'
And don't ask me where I'm bound
I can't stay here any longer
'Cause my sweet love ain't around.

(Two additional verses not on record)

Memories come back to haunt me
My dream house has done fell down
This old world is dark around me
'Cause my sweet love ain't around.

Something tells me that I'm losing
'Cause these weary blues I've found
Oh, my baby left this morning
Lord, my sweet love ain't around.
