{title: Can't You Hear Me Calling}

[C]The days are dark, the nights are lonely
Since you [F]left me all [C]alone
I've worried [F]so my little [C]darling
I've loved you [G]so even though you have [C]gone

{start_of_chorus}
Sweetheart of [C]mine, can't you hear me callin'
A million [F]times I loved you [C]best
I mistreated [F]you, lord, and I'm [C]sorry
Come back to [G]me is my [C]request
{end_of_chorus}

I remember, dear, the night we parted
A big mistake has caused it all
If you return, sunshine will follow
If you stay away the rain will fall

The days are dark, the nights are lonely
How I need your sweet embrace
When I awoke the sun was shining
I looked up and I saw your face
