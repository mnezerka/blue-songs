{title: Can't You Hear Me Calling}

[G]The days are dark, the nights are lonely
Since you [C]left me all [G]alone
I've worried [C]so my little [G]darling
I've loved you [C]so [D]even though you have [G]gone

{start_of_chorus}
[G]Sweetheart of mine, can't you hear me callin'
A million [C]times I loved you [G]best
I mistreated [C]you, lord, and I'm [G]sorry
Come back to [C]me [D]is my re[G]quest
{end_of_chorus}

I remember, dear, the night we parted
A big mistake has caused it all
If you return, sunshine will follow
If you stay away the rain will fall

The days are dark, the nights are lonely
How I need your sweet embrace
When I awoke the sun was shining
I looked up and I saw your face
