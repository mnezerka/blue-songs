{start_of_chorus}
[C]There's more pretty girls than one[C7]
[F]More pretty girls then [C]one
[F]Any old town that I [C]ramble all around
There's more pretty [G]girls than [C]one

[C]Mama talked to [G]me last [C]night[C7]
She [F]gave to me some good ad[C]vice[C7]
She said [F]"Son, you ought to quit this old [C]ramblin' all around
And mary you a [G]sweet loving [C]wife"

Honey, look down that old lonesome road
Hang down your pretty head and cry
'Cause I'm thinking all about them pretty little gals
And hoping that I'll never die
