{title: Shady Grove}

[Dm]Peaches in the [C]summertime
[Dm]Apples in the fall
If I can't have the [C]girl I love
I [Am]don't want none at [Dm]all

[Dm]Shady grove, [C]my little love
[Dm]Shady grove, I know
[F]Shady grove, [C]my little love
I'm [Am]bound for shady [Dm]grove

Wish I had a banjo string
Made of golden twine
Every tune I'd play on it
I wish that girl was mine

Wish I had a needle and thread
Fine as I could sew
I'd sew that pretty girl to my side
And down the road I'd go

Some come here to fiddle and dance
Sme come here to tarry
Some come here to fiddle and dance
I come here to marry

Every night when I go home
My wife, I try to please her
The more I try, the worse she gets
Damned if I don't leave her
