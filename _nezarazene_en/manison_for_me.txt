{title: Mansion For Me}
{subtitle: written by Bill Monroe, recorded By Ricky Skaggs and Tony Rice}

[C]There's folks building homes as [F]sweet as can [C]be
They're leveling their yards and planting their [G7]trees
But my little [C]hut I'll [F]just let it [C]be
Lord Jesus is [G7]building a mansion for [C]me

{start_of_chorus}
[C]A mansion for me (a mansion for me)
A [F]mansion for [C]me (a mansion for me)
Built by my Lord beyond Calv[G7]ary
But my little [C]hut I'll [F]just let it [C]be
Lord Jesus is [G7]building a mansion for [C]me
{end_of_chorus}

Each day I am getting more ready to go
He's cleansing my sins more whiter than snow
I'm packing my troubles I'm bound with His love
Get ready to move to Heaven above               

To you who have homes in this world below
Driving fine cars wherever you go
There's coming a time it will all pass away
Get ready to move with me on that day
