{title: Dark Hollow}

I'd rather be in some dark hollow
Where the sun don't ever shine
Than to be here alone knowing that you're gone
It would cause me to lose my mind

{start_of_chorus}
So blow your whistle freight train
Blow it far on down the track
I'm going away, I'm leaving today
I'm going but I ain't coming back
{end_of_chorus}

I'd rather be in some dark hollow
Where the sun don't ever shine
Than to be here some big city
In a small room with you love on my mind
