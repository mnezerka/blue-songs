{title: Dark Hollow}

I'd rather [G]be in [D]some dark [G]hollow
Where the sun don't [C]ever [G]shine
Than to be here a[G]lone [C]knowing that you're gone
It would [G]cause me to [D]lose my [G]mind

{start_of_chorus}
So blow your whistle freight train
Blow it far on down the track
I'm going away, I'm leaving today
I'm going but I ain't coming back
{end_of_chorus}

I'd rather be in some dark hollow
Where the sun don't ever shine
Than to be here some big city
In a small room with you love on my mind
