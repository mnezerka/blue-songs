{title: Steel Rails}

{soc}
[C]Steel rails chasing [Dm]sunshine round the bend
[F]Winding through the [G]trees like a [F]ribbon in the [C]wind
I don't mind, not knowing [Dm]what lies down the track
Cause I'm [F]looking out [G]ahead to keep my [F]mind from turning [C]back

It's not the first time, I found myself alone at dawn
If I really had you once, then Id have you when I'm gone
Whistle blowing, blowing lonesome in my mind
Calling me along that never ending metal line

Sun is shining through the open box car door
Calling me away to the things Ive known before
I've lost count of the hours days and times
Just the rhythm of the rails keeps the motion in my mind
