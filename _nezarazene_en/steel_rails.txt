{title: Steel Rails}

{soc}
[C]Steel rails chasing [Dm]sunshine round the bend
[F]Winding through the [G]trees like a [F]ribbon in the [C]wind
I don't mind, not knowing [Dm]what lies down the track
Cause I'm [F]looking out [G]ahead to keep my [F]mind from turning [C]back
{eoc}

[G]It's not the first time, I found [Dm]myself alone at dawn
[F]If I really had you [G]once, then Id [F]have you when I'm [C]gone
Whistle blowing, blowing [Dm]lonesome in my mind
[F]Calling me [G]along that never [F]ending metal [C]line

Sun is shining through the open box car door
Calling me away to the things Ive known before
I've lost count of the hours days and times
Just the rhythm of the rails keeps the motion in my mind
