{title: Rain and Snow}

[D]I married me a [C]wife
She gave me troubles all my life
Let me out in the [C]cold rain and [D]snow
Rain and sno[C]w, ooh [D]oh lord
Let out in the [C]cold rain and [D]snow

Ive done all I can do, just to try and get along with you
And I aint going to be treated this away
This away a ay, a oh lord
And I aint going to be treated this away

She came into the room, where she met her final doom
And I aint going to be treated this away
This away, oh lord
And I aint going to be treated this away

She came down the stairs, combing back her long yellow hair
And her cheeks were as red as a rose
As a rose, oh lord
And her cheeks were as red as a rose
