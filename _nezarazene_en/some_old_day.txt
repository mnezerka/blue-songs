{title: Some Old Day}
{subtitle: Herb Pederson}

I’ve been working out in the rain tied to this dirty old ball and chain
Oh dear mother I’ll come home some old day
Some sweet day they’ll turn me loose from this dirty old calaboose
Oh dear mother I’ll come home some old day

{start_of_chorus}
Some old day You’ll wait for me and pray
Oh dear mother I’ll be home some old day
Some sweet day they’ll turn me loose from this dirty old calaboose
Oh dear mother I’ll come home some old day
{end_of_chorus}

Oh mother I’ve hurt you so and I’ve been cruel to you I know
Oh dear mother I’ll come home some old day
Tell my brothers and sister that they’re the best friends that I’ve had
Oh dear mother I’ll come home some old day
