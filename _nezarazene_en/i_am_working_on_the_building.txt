Well, if I was a sinner I’d a tell you what I would do
I would quit my sinnin’ and I’d work on a buildin’ too

{start_of_chorus}
I’m workin’ on a buildin’, I’m workin’ on a buildin’
I’m workin’ on a buildin’ for my Lord, for my Lord
It’s a Holy Ghost buildin’, it’s a holy ghost buildin’
It’s a Holy Ghost buildin’ for my Lord, for my Lord
{end_of_chorus}

Well, if I was a gambler I tell you what I would do
I would quit my gamblin’ and work on a buildin’ too

Well, if I was a drunkard I tell you what I would do
I would quit my drinkin’ and work on a buildin’ too

Well, if I was a preacher I tell you what I would do
I would go on preachin’ and I’d work on a buildin’ too
