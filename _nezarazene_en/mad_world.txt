[Em]All around me are [G]familiar faces;
[D]worn out places, [A]worn out faces
[Em]Bright and early for the [G]daily races;
[D]going nowhere, [A]going nowhere
[Em]Their tears are filling [G]up their glasses;
[D]no expression, [A]no expression
[Em]Hide my head I wanna [G]drown my sorrow;
[D] no tomorrow, [A]no tomorrow

[Em]And I find it kind of [A]funny;
[Em]I find it kind of [A]sad
[Em]The dreams in which I'm [A]dying, 
[Em]are the best I've ever [A]had
[Em]I find it hard to [A]tell you;
[Em]I find it hard to [A]take
[Em]When people run in [A]circles,
it's a very, very, [Em]mad [A]world, [Em]mad [A]world

Children waiting for the day they feel good;
happy birthday, happy birthday
And I feel the way that every child should;
sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous;
no one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson;
look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kind of funny;
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying, 
are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you;
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles,
it's a very, very, mad world, mad world
Enlarge your world, mad world
