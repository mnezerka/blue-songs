[D]Devil had a daughter
Took him to deep water
[G]Tried to kill him [F]with a [D]kiss
He said hey now honey
What about the money
[G]I said I ain’t got [F]time for [D]this

{start_of_chorus}
[G]Take me take me somewhere trouble don’t [D]go
[G]Make me make me someone trouble don’t [D]know

She said baby come inside
I said sorry I got to ride
Sorry but I got to ride
You know you could end up dead
For sleeping in the devil’s bed
Sleeping in a devil’s bed

Baby wants to drive my car
But she wants to go too far
But she wants to go too far
First comes love and it’s so fine
Then comes heartache right behind
Then comes heartache behind

My baby used to be so sweet
Now he won’t come down my street
Now he won’t come down my street
All my plans got derailed
She locked up my heart in jail
She locked up my heart in jail
