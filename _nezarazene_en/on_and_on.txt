{title: On And On}

[G]Traveling down this [C]long lonesome [G]highway
I'm so lonesome I could [D]cry
[G]Memories of how we [C]once loved each [G]other
And now we are [D]saying good-[G]bye.

{start_of_chorus}
[G]On and on I'll [C]follow my [G]darling
And I wonder where she can [D]be
[G]On and on I'll [C]follow my [G]darling
And I wonder if she [D]ever thinks of [G]me.
{end_of_chorus}

I've cried I've cried for you little darling
It breaks my heart to hear your name
My friends they also love you my darling
And they think that I am to blame.

I have to follow you my darling
I can't sleep when the sun goes down
By your side is my destination
The road is clear and that's where I'm bound.
