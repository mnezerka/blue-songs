{title: Old Home Place}

[G]Its been ten [H7]long years since I [C]left my [G]home
The hollow where I was [D]born
Where the [G]cool fall [H7]nights makes the [C]wood snow [G]brize
And the fox hunter [D]blows his [G]horn

I fell in love with a girl from the town
I thought that she would be true
I ran away to Charlottesville
And worked in a sawmill too

{soc}
[D]What have you done to the [G]old home place
[A]Why did they tear it [D]down?
And [G]why did I [H7]live the [C]plow in the [G]fields
And look for a [D]job in the [G]town
{eoc}

Well,the girl ran of with somebody else
The tariffs took all my pay
And here I stand where the old home stood
Before they took it away

Now the geese fly south and the cold wind blows
As I stand here and hang my head
I've lost my love,I've lost my home
And now I wish that I was dead
