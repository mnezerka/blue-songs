{title: Rock, Salt And Nails}

[E]On the banks of the rive[A]r, where the willows hang [E]down 
Where the wild birds all [C#m]warble [A]with a low moaning [E]sound 
Down in the [C#m]hollow[A] where the water runs [E]cold 
It was there I first [A]listened to the lies that you [E]told 
 
Now I lie on my bed and I can see your sweet face 
The past I remember time cannot erase 
The letter you wrote me it was written in shame 
And I know that your conscience still echos my name 
 
Now the nights are so [E]lon[A]e Lord sorrow runs [E]deep [A]
Nothing is [E]wors[A]e than a night without [E]sleep [A] 
I walk out [E]alon[A]e and look at the [E]sky [A] 
Too empty to [E]sing[A], too lonesome to [E]cry [A] 
 
If the ladies were blackbirds and the ladies were thrushes 
I'd lie there for hours in the chilly cold marshes 
If the ladies were squirrels  with them high bushy tails 
I'd fill up my shotgun with rock salt and nails
