{title: Amazing Grace}

{start_of_chorus}
[G]Amazing grace, how [C]sweet the [G]sound
That saved a wretch like [D]me
I [G]once was lost, but [C]now I'm [G]found
I was blind, but [D]now I [G]see
{end_of_chorus}

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fear relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
