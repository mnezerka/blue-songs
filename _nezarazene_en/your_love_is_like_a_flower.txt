{title: Your Love Is Like A Flower}

It was long, long ago in the moonlight
We were sitting on the banks of the stream
When you whispered so sweetly, I love you
As the waters murmured a tune

Oh, they tell me your love is like a flower
In the springtime blossoms so fair
In the fall then they wither away, dear
And they tell me that's the way of your love

I remember the night, little darling
We were talking of days gone by
When you told me you always would love me
That for me your love would never die

It was spring when you whispered these words, dear
The flowers were all blooming so fair
But today as the snow falls around us
I can see that your love is not there
