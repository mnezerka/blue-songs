{title: Midnight On The Stormy Deep}

[D]T'was midnight on the [A]stormy [D]deep
My solitary watch I'd ke[D7]ep
And think of [G]her I'd left be[D]hind
And ask if [A7]she'd be true and [D]kind

I never shall forget the day
That I was forced to go away
In silence there my head she'd rest
And held me to her loving breast

Oh Willy don't go back to sea
There's other girls as good as me
But none can love you true as I
Pray don't go where the bullets fly

The deep deep sea may us divide
And I may be some other's bride
But still my thoughts will oft times stray
To be with thou so far away

I never have proved false to thee
The love I gave was true and kind
But you have proved untrue to me
I can no longer call thee mine

So fare-thee-well I'd rather make
My home upon some icy lake
Where the southern sun refused to shine
Then to trust a love so false as thine
