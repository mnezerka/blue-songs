{title: Don't Let Your Deal Go Down}

I've Been All Around This Whole Wide World,
Way Down in Memphis Tennessee.
Any Old Place I Hang My Hat
Seems Like Home to Me.

{start_of_chorus}
Don't Let Your Deal Go Down.
Don't Let Your Deal Go Down.
Don't Let Your Deal Go Down, Sweet Mama
Till Your Last Old Dollar's Gone.
{end_of_chorus}

When I Left My Love Behind,
She's Standin' in the Door;
She Throwed Her Little Arms Around My Neck and Said,
"Sweet Daddy Please Don't Go!"

Now It's Who's Gonna Shoe Your Pretty Little Feet?
Who's Gonna Glove Your Hand?
And Who's Gonna Kiss Your Ruby Lips
Honey, Who's Gonna Be Your Man?

She Says, "Papa Will Shoe My Pretty Little Feet,
Manma Will Glove My Hand.
You Can Kiss My Rosy Lips
When You Get Back Again."

Where Did You Get Them High-heel Shoes.
And That Dress You Wear So Fine?
Got Nry Shoes From a Railroad Man
Dress From a Driver in the Mine.
