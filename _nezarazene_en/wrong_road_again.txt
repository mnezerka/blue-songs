{title: Wrong Road Again}

[G]I can't seem to [C]learn not to [G]love you
You get to [D7]me every [G]time
You're someone I [C]just can't say [G]no to
And you're so good at [D7]changing my [G]mind

{soc}
Here I go down that [C]wrong road a[G]gain
Going back where I've [D7]already [G]been
Even knowing [C]where it will [G]end
Here I go down that [D7]wrong road a[G]gain
{eoc}

Though I see the web that you're weaving
You and your soft easy lines
Before I stop to think I'm believing
And I'm falling for you one more time
