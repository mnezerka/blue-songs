{title: Salty Dog Blues}
{subtitle: Lester Flatt & Earl Scruggs}

[G]Standin on the corner with the low down blues
[A]Great big hole in the bottom of my shoes
[D]Honey let me be your Salty [G]Dog.

{start_of_chorus}
[G]Let me be your [E]Salty Dog
Or [A]I won't be your man at all
[D]Honey let me be your Salty [G]Dog.
{end_of_chorus}

Listen here Sal, well I know you
Run down stockin' and a worn out shoe
Honey let me be your Salty Dog.

Down in the wildwood sitting on a log
Finger on the trigger and eye on the hog
Honey let me be your Salty Dog.

Pulled the trigger and they said go
Shot fell over in Mexico
Honey let me be you Salty Dog.
