{title: Blue Kentucky  Wind}
{artist: Les Taylor, Lou Reid & Carolina}

[G]Raindrops fall in the pale moonlight
On a cabin high just about [D]midnight
Thought I saw a [C]face through the window [G]pane
Reaching out to [D]me and calling my [G]name
[G]It was a year ago, to this very day
She disappeared, without a [D]trace
Some say a [C]man, from [G]Tennessee
Came and took my [D]baby from [G]me

{soc}
Now her spirit [C]moves, through the tall pine [G]trees
Coming in my [C]door, laying next to [D]me
I hear her [C]howling in the holler
She’s [F]come back [Bb]home [C]again
[Bb]Blowing in the [C]Blue Kentucky [G]Wind
[Bb]Ooh Ooh Ooh [F]Ooh, Blue Kentucky [G]Wind
{eoc}

Now every night, She’s in my dreams
Dressed in white, by a mountain stream
Then I awake, in a cold cold sweat
From reliving what I’ll always regret
Cause back in the woods, where no one goes
There’s two graves, where the water flows
I pay my respects, to my Marie
And I cuss that no good man from Tennessee
 
Chorus
