{title: Wayfaring Stranger}

[Dmi]I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
A-traveling [Gmi]through this world of [Dmi]woe
[Dmi]And there's no sadness, toil or danger
To that bright [Gmi]world to which I [Dmi]go

{start_of_chorus}
I'm going [B]there to meet my [F]Father
I'm going [B]there no more to [A7]roam
I'm just a-[Dmi]going over Jordan
I'm just a-[Gmi]going over [Dmi]home
{end_of_chorus}

I know dark clouds will gather round me
I know my way is rough and steep
But beautios fields lie just before me
Where soul's redeemed that vigils keep
