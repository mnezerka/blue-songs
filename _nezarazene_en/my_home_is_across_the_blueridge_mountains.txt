My home’s across the blueridge mountains
My home’s across the blueridge mountains
My home’s across the blueridge mountains
And I never expect to see you anymore

How can I keep from cryin’ (x3)
For I never expect to see you anymore

I’m gonna leave here Monday morning (x3)
Oh, I never expect to see you anymore

Goodbye my little Nashville darlin’ (x3)
Oh, I never expect to see you anymore
