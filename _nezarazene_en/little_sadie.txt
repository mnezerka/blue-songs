{title: Little Sadie}

[Em]Went out one [G]night for to make a little [Em]round,
[D]met little Sadie and shot her [Hm]down.
Went back home, got into bed,
[A]forty-four pistol under my [Em]head.

Woke up the next morning about half past nine,
the hacks and the buggies all standing in line.
Gents and gamblers standin' around,
carried little Sadie to her buryin' ground.

Well I began to think what a deed I'd done,
grabbed my hat and away I run.
Made a good run but a little too slow,
they overtook me in Jericho.

Standin' on the corner a readin' the bill,
when up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville.
He said young man ain't your name Brown,
remember that night you shot Sadie down.

Well I said yes sir but my name is Lee,
and I shot little Sadie in the first degree.
First degree, second degree,
if you got any papers won't you read them to me.

They took me down town, dressed me in black,
put me on a train and started me back.
All the way back to Thomasville jail,
I had no money for to go my bail.

Well the judge and the jury took their stand,
the judge had the paper in his right hand.
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
forty-one years with the ball and stripes.
