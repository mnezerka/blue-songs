{title: Rocky Top}

Wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Ain’t no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top
Ain’t no telephone bills

Once I had a girl on Rocky Top
Half bear other half cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop
I still dream about that

{start_of_chorus}
Rocky Top you’ll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good old Rocky Top, Rocky Top Tennessee
Rocky Top, Tennessee
{end_of_chorus}

Once two strangers climbed old rocky top
Lookin’ for a moonshine still
Strangers ain’t come down from rocky top
Reckon they never will

Corn won’t grown at all on rocky top
Dirt’s too rocky by far
That’s why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar

I’ve had years of cramped up city life
Trapped like a duck in a pen
All I know is it’s a pity life
Can’t be simple again
