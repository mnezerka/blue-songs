{title: In The Pines}

[G]The longest train I [C]ever [G]saw 
Went down that [D]Georgia [G]Line 
The engine passed at [C]six [G]o'clock 
The caboose went [D]by at [G]nine 

{start_of_chorus}
In the pines, in the pines,
where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows 
{end_of_chorus}

My love, my love, what have I done
To make you treat me so
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
You've caused me to leave my home
