{title: Little Maggie}

[G]Oh yonder stands little [F]Maggie,
With a [G]dram glass [D]in her [G]hand.
Passing away her [F]troubles
By [G]courting some [D]other [G]man.

Oh how can I ever stand it
Just to see those two blue eyes,
A-shining in the moonlight
Like two diamonds in the skies.

Pretty flowers were made for blooming
Pretty stars were made to shine,
Pretty women were made for loving
Little Maggie was made to be mine.

Last time I saw little Maggie
She was setting on the banks of the sea,
With a forty-for around her
And banjo on her knee.

Lay down your last gold dollar
Lay down your gold watch and chain.
Little Maggie's gonna dance for daddy
Listen to this old banjo ring.

Going down to the station
With my suitcase in my hand.
I'm going away for to ave you,
I'm going to some far-of land.

Go away,go away little Maggie
Go and the best you can.
I'll get me another woman
You can get you another man.
