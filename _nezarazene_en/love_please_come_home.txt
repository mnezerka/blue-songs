As you [G]read this letter that I write to [F]you
Sweet[C]heart I hope you’ll under[G]stand
That [C]you’re the only love I [G]knew
Please for[D]give me if you [G]can

I promise that I’ll treat you right
Love, oh love, oh please come home

And the fire is burning low
The snow has covered up the ground
