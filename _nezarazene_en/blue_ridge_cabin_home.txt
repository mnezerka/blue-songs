{title: Blue Ridge Cabin Home}

[G]There's a well beaten path in the [C]old mountainside
Where I [D]wandered when I was a [G]lad
And I wandered alone to the [C]place I call home
In those [D]Blue Ridge hills far a[G]way

{start_of_chorus}
[G]Oh I love those hills of old Vir[C]ginia
From those [D]Blue Ridge hills I did [G]roam
When I die won't you bury me on the [C]mountain
Far a[D]way near my Blueridge mountain [G]home
{end_of_chorus}

Now my thoughts wander back to that ramshackle shack
In those blue ridge hills far away
Where my mother and dad were laid there to rest
They are sleeping in peace together there

I return to that old cabin home with the sigh
I've been longing for days gone by
When I die won't you bury me on that old mountain side
Make my resting place upon the hills so high
