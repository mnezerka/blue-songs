{title: Will The Circle Be Unbroken}

[C]I was standing by my window[C7]
On a [F]cold and cloudy [C]day,
When I saw the hearse come rollin'[Am]
to [C]carry my [G]mother [C]away. 

{start_of_chorus}
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by Lord, by and by,
There's a better home a-waitin'
In the sky Lord, in the sky. 
{end_of_chorus}

I said to the undertaker,
"Undertaker, please drive slow,
For that body you are carrying'
Lord, I hate to see her go."

Well I followed close behind her,
Tried to hold up and be brave,
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave

I went back home, Lord, my home was lonesome,
since my mother, she was gone.
All my brothers and sisters crying
What a home so sad and alone.
