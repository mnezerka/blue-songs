{title: Keep On The Sunny Side}

[C]There’s a dark and a [F]troubled side of [C]life
There’s a bright and a sunny side [G]too
Though you meet with the darkness and [C]strife
The [G]sunny side may also find [C]you

{start_of_chorus}
[C]Keep on the sunny side, [F]always on the [C]sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of [G]life
It will [C]help us every day, it will [F]brighten all the [C]way
If we keep [F]on the [C]sunny [G]side of [C]life
{end_of_chorus}

Oh the storm and its fury broke today
Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear
Clouds and storms will in time pass away
The sun again will shine bright and clear

Let us greet with a song of hope each day
Though the moment be cloudy or fair
Let us trust in our savior away
Who keepeth every one in his care
