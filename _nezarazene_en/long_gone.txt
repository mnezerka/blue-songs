{title: Long Gone}

{start_of_chorus}
[G]Long gone it's how I'm leaving
Long [C]gone, why do you [G]cry
This is [G]what you wanted baby
So I'm [D]gone, long [G]gone
{end_of_chorus}

I have tried to make you happy
Still you say You've done me wrong
This is it, we're through forever
So I'm gone, long gone

Please don't shed no tears at parting
For those tears they won't atone
After all this pain you've caused me
I'm gone, long gone
