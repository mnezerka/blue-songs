{title: Nine Pound Hammer}

[G]This nine pound hammer is a little too [C]heavy
It`s for my [G]size, [D]only for my [G]size

{start_of_chorus}
[G]Roll on buddy, don't you roll so [C]slow
Baby how can [G]roll, [D]when the wheels won't [G]go
{end_of_chorus}

I'm going on the mountain, go to see my baby
But I ain't coming back, Lord I ain't coming back 

It's a long way to Hazard, and a long way to Harlen
Just to get a little brooze, just to get a little brooze

This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
It`s my size, only for my size
