{title: Summertime}

Summer time,
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high

Your daddy's rich
And your mamma's good lookin'
So hush little baby
Don't you cry

One of these mornings
You're gonna rise up singing
You'll spread your wings
And you'll take to the sky

But till that morning
Nothing is going to harm you
With yor daddy and mummy
standing by
