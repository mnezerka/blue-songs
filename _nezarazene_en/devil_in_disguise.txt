[G][F][C][G]

{start_of_chorus}
[G]She's the [F]devil in dis[G]guise
You can [F]see it in her [C]eyes
She's telling dirty [G]lies
She's the [F]devil in dis[C]guise, in dis[G]guise [F][C][G]
{end_of_chorus}

Now a [G]woman like that [C]all she does is [G]hate you
She doesn't know what [C]makes a man a [G]man
She'll talk about the [C]times that she's been [G]with you
She'll [C]speak your name with everyone she [G]can

Unhappiness has been her close companion
Her will is filled of jealousy and doubt
It gets her up to see a person crying
She's just the kind that you can live without

Her number always turns up in your pocket
Whenever you are looking for a dime
Well it's all right to call her but I'll bet you
That the moon is full and you're just wasting time
