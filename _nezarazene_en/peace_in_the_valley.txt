{title: Peace in the Valley}
{subtitle: recorded by Johnny Cash, written by Thomas A. Dorsey}

I am tired and weary but I must toil on
Till the Lord comes to call me away
Well the morning's so bright and the lamb is the light
And the night is as fair as the day

{start_of_chorus}
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me I pray
No more sorrow and sadness or troubles will be
There will be peace in the valley for  me
{end_of_chorus}

Where the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb
And the beasts from the wild shall be led by a child
And I'll be changed from this creature I  am
