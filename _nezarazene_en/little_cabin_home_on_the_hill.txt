{title: Little Cabin Home On The Hill}

Tonight I’m alone without you my dear
It seems there’s a longing for you still
All I have to do is sit alone and cry
In our little cabin home on the hill

{start_of_chorus}
Oh, someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
Listen to the rain upon the window pane
In our little cabin home on the hill
{end_of_chorus}

I hope you are happy tonight as you are
But in my heart there’s a-longing for you still
I just keep it there so I won’t be alone
In our little cabin home on the hill

Now when you have come to the end of the day
And find there’s no more happiness for you
Just let your thoughts turn back once more if you will
To our little cabin home on the hill
