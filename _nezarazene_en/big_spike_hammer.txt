[G]Can't you hear the ripple of my [Em]big spike hammer
[C]Lord it's busting my [Em]side
I've done [G]all I can do to keep that [Em]woman
[C]Still she's not satis[Em]fied [D]

[G]Hey hey Della Mae
Why do you treat me this way
Hey hey Della Mae
I'll get even some day
{end_of_chorus}

I'm the best hammer swinger in this big section gang
Big Bill Johnson is my  name
This spike  hammer that I swing for a dollar and a half a day
It's all for my Della Mae

Well I've been lots of places, not much I ain't done
There's still a lot of things I'd like to see
But this hammer that I swing or the woman that I love
Yeah  one's gonna be the death of me
