{title: I wonder where you are tonight}

Tonight I'm sad, my heart is weary
I'm wond'ring if I'm wrong or right
Altho' you've gone and found another
I wonder where you are tonight

{start_of_chorus}
That old rain is cold and slowly fallin'
Upon my window pane tonight
And tho' your love was even colder
I wonder where you are tonight
{end_of_chorus}

Your heart was cold, you never loved me
Tho' you said you often cared
And now you've gone and found another
Someone who knows the love I shared

Then came the dawn that day you left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me
That lingers in my heart tonight
