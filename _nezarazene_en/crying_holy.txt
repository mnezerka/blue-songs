{title: Crying Holy}

{start_of_chorus}
[G]Crying holy unto the Lord
Crying [C]holy unto the [G]Lord
Oh, [G]if I could I surely would
Stand on the rock [D]where Moses [G]stood.
{end_of_chorus}

Sinners run and hide your face
Sinners run and hide your face
Run to the rocks and hide your face
'cause I ain't no stranger now

Lord, I ain't no stranger now
Lord, I ain't no stranger now
I paid any dues to the father and the son
And I ain't no stranger now
