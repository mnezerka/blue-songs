{title: Bury Me Beneath The Willow}

[D]My heart is sad and [G]I am lonely
[D]For the only one I [A]love
When [D]shall I see her [G]oh no never
[D]Til we [A]meet in heaven a[D]bove

{start_of_chorus}
Oh bury me beneath the willow
Under the weeping willow tree
So she will know where I am sleeping
And perhaps she'll weep for me
{end_of_chorus}

She told me that she dearly loved me
How could I believe it untrue
Until the angels softly whispered
She will prove untrue to you

Tomorrow was our wedding day
Oh God, oh God where can she be
She's out acourting with another
And no longer cares for me
