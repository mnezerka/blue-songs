{title: Roll in My Sweet Baby's Arms}

{start_of_chorus}
[G]Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's [D]arms
[G]Lay around my shack till the [C]mail train comes back
Then I'll [G]roll in my [D]sweet baby's [G]arms
{end_of_chorus}

I ain't gonna work on the railroad
I ain't gonna work on the farm
Lay 'round my shack till the mail train comes back
And I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms

Now where was you last Friday night
While I was lying in jail
Walkin' the street with another man
Wouldn't even go my bail

I know your parents don't like me
They drove me away from your door
If I had my life to live over
I'd never go there any more
