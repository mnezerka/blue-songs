{title: Where The Soul Of Man Never Dies}

[D]To Canaan's land, I'm on my way,
Where the soul (of man) never [A]dies
My [D]darkest night will turn to day
Where the soul (of man) [A]never [D]dies

{start_of_chorus}
No sad farewells (Dear friends there'll be no sad farewells)
No tear dimmed eyes (There'll be no tear dimmed eyes)
Where all is love (Where all is peace and joy and love)
And the soul never dies (And the soul of man never dies)
{end_of_chorus}

The rose is blooming there for me
Where the soul (of man) never dies
And I will spend eternity
Where the soul (of man) never dies

The love light beams across the foam
Where the soul (of man) never dies
It shines and lights the way to home
Where the soul (of man) never dies.
