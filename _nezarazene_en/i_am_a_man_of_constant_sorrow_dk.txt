{title: I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow}

[F]I am a man of constant [Bb]sorrow
I've seen [C]trouble all my [F]days
I  bid farewell to old Ken[Bb]tucky 
The place where [C]I was born and [F]raised
The place where [C]he was born and [F]raised

For six long years I've been in trouble 
No pleasure here on earth I've found 
For in this world I'm bound to ramble 
I have no friends to help me down 
He has no friends to help him down
 
It's fare thee well my old true lover 
I never expect to see you again 
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad 
Perhaps I'll die upon this train 
Perhaps he'll die upon this train
 
You can bury me in sunny valley 
For many years where I may lay 
And you may learn to love another 
While I am sleeping in my grave 
While he is sleeping in his grave

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger 
My face you never will see no more 
But there is one promise that is given 
I'll meet you on God's golden shore 
He'll meet you on God's golden shore
