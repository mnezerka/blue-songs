{start_of_chorus}
[E]Hold whatcha got, I'm a-coming home baby
[A]Hold whatcha got, and I don't mean maybe
[E]And I'm a-thinking about you and I'm on my [H]way
Don't [E]sell the house, don't wreck the car
[A]Stay there, honey, right where you are
If you [E]hold whatcha got, I'm [H]a-coming home to [E]stay
{end_of_chorus}

Well in my mind I can see you
That's a mighty good sigh that I need you
That's why I can't wait to get back home
So squeeze yourself real good and tight
And I'll be home before daylight
If you hold whatcha got, I'm a-coming home to stay

When I get back I ain't leavin'
Been too alone, been too much grieven'
When I get back, honey, this time I'm going to stay
We won't fuss, we won't fight
This time things gonna be all right
Hold whatcha got, I'm a-coming home to stay
