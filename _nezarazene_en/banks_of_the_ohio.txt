{title: Banks Of The Ohio}

[D]I asked my love to take a [A]walk
Just a walk a little [D]way
As we walk, oh, may we [G]talk
All a[D]bout [A]our wedding [D]day

{start_of_chorus}
Only say that you'll be mine
In our home we'll happy be
Down beside where the wathers flow
On the banks of the Ohio
{end_of_chorus}

I took her by her lily white hand
And dragged her down that bank of sand
There I throwed her into drown
I watched her as she floated down

Was walking home between twelve and one
A-thinkin' of what I had done
I killed a girl I'd loved you see
Because she would not marry me

It was in my home about half past four
The sherif's man knocked at my door
Said now young man come now and go
Down to the banks of the Ohio.
