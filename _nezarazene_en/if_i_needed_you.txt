{title: If I Needed You}
{subtitle: from The Broken Circle Breakdown}

{start_of_chorus}
If I needed you, would you come to me
Would come to me for to ease my pain?
And if you needed me, I would come to you
I would swim the seas for to ease your pain
{end_of_chorus}

Well the night's forlorn and the morning's born
And the morning shines with the lights of love
And you will miss sunrise if you close your eyes
And that would break my heart in two

Lady's with me now since I showed her how
To lay her lilly hands in mine
And who would not agree she's a sight to see
And a treasure for the poor to find
