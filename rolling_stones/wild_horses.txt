[Hm]Childhood [G]living 
[Hm]Is easy to [G]do 
[Am]The things you [C]wanted [D]
[G]I bought them for [D]you 

Graceless lady 
You know who I am 
You know I can't let you
Slide through my hands

[Am]Wild [C]horses [D]
[G]Couldn't [F]drag me a[C]way 
[Am]Wild, wild [C]horses [D]
[G]Couldn't [F]drag me a[C]way

I watched you suffer 
A dull aching pain 
Now you've decided 
To show me the same 

No sweeping exits 
Or offstage lines 
Could make me feel bitter 
Or treat you unkind 

[F][F][C][C][F][F][C][D][G][G][G][G]

I know I've dreamed you
A sin and a lie 
I got my freedom 
But I don't have much time 

Faith has been broken 
Tears must be cried 
Let's do some living 
After we die
