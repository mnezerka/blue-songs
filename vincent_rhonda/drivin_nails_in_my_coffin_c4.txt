{title: Drivin' Nails In My Coffin}

My [G]sweetheart is gone and I'm so lonely.
He said that he and I were [D]through.
So I [G]started out drinkin' for pastime:
Drivin' nails in my [D]coffin over [G]you. 

{start_of_chorus}
I'm just [G]drivin' nails in my coffin,
Every time I drink a bottle of [D]booze.
I'm just [D]drivin' nails in my coffin:
Drivin' those [D]nails over [G]you.
{end_of_chorus}

Ever since the day that we parted,
I've been so sad and so blue.
I'm always thinkin' of you, love,
And I just can't quit drinkin' that old booze.

You turned me down, you don't want me.
There's nothin' now I can lose.
I'm just drivin' those nails in my coffin.
An' worryin', my darlin', over you.
