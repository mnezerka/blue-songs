{title: World's Biggest Fool}

[G]I'm not that lonely anymore
[G]I hardly ever walk the floor
I don't [D7]cry every night like I [G]used to

No, I don't wear your stupid ring
I wouldn't hang on to the thing
It's the last thing I have to hold on to

{start_of_chorus}
[G]And if [A]you believe that you be[D7]lieve anything
So [A]while I've got your undi[D7]vided attention
I [G]think I discovered the [A]truth
One of [D7]us is the world's biggest fool
{end_of_chorus}

I took your pictures off the wall
There's nothing left 'round here at all
To remind me of when we were together

Yeah, life is perfect everyday
There ain't a thing that I would change
And I hope that it stays like this forever

And if you believe that you believe anything
So while I've got your undivided attention
I think I discovered the truth
One of us is the world's biggest fool

Yeah, I blame you and you blame me
That's what they said in therapy
Now we say that we're through with one another

I hope the dog is doing fine
No, I still haven't changed my mind
And you know I love livin' with my mother

And if you believe that you believe anything
So while I've got your undivided attention
I think I discovered the truth
One of us is the world's biggest fool
Oh, yeah, I think I discovered the truth
One of us is the world's biggest fool
