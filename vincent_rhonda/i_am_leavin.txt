{title: I'm Leavin} 

I'm [C]leavin'
[C]Don't even try and slow me down
Yeah I'm [F]leavin'
Gonna travel out of this [C]town
I'm tired of [G]grieving
Misery is all I've [C]found

Tears
Can't dry the tears from my eyes
Lonesome teardrops
All I do is sit and cry
Gotta stop the teardrops
And shake the memories from my mind

{start_of_chorus}
All you [F]do is tie me down
These [F]ropes have got me bound
And I [F]can't take the strain
That's why I'm [C]grieving
This [F]misery and pain
Are [F]driving me insane
And I've [F]had a change of heart
So start be[G]lieving
{end_of_chorus}

That I'm leavin'
Don't even try and slow me down
Yeah I'm leavin'
Gotta travel out of this town
I'm tired of grieving
Misery is all I've found

Heartache
It's a sad and lonesome time
Painful heartache
Oh relief I can not find
I gotta mend the heartbreak
Of these old blues I'll leave behind

All you do is tie me down
These ropes have got me bound
And I can't take the strain
That's why I'm grieving
This misery and pain
Are driving me insane
And I've had a change of heart
So start believing

That I'm leavin'
Don't even try and slow me down
Yeah I'm leavin'
Happiness is where I'm bound
No more grieving
Goodbye to you I'm out of this town

I'm leavin'
I'm leavin'
