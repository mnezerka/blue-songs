{title: Fishers of Men}

{start_of_chorus}
Rise and follow me
I'll make you worthy
Rise and follow me
I'll make you fishers of men
{end_of_chorus}

Peter, John, and James
Could never be the same
After they heard him say
I'll make you fishers of men

Cast your nets aside 
and join the battle tide 
He will be your guide 
To make you fishers of men

Jesus bore the cross 
To gather in the lost 
Oh what a might cost 
To set us free from sin
