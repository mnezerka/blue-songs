{title: Blaze of Glory}

[Dm]I wake up in the morning and I [C]raise my weary head
I've got an [G]old coat for a pillow, and the [Dm] earth was last night's bed
I [F]don't know where I'm going, only [C]God knows where I've been
I'm a [G] devil on the run, a six gun lover, a [Dm] candle in the wind

When you're brought into this world, they say you're born in sin
Well at least they gave me something  I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well they tell me that I'm wanted,    yeah I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable I'm what Cain was to Abel Mister catch me if you can

{soc}
I'm going [G]down in a blaze of g[D]lory
Take me [G]now but know the [D]truth
I'm going [G]out in a blaze of g[D]lory
Lord I [C]never drew first, but I drew first blood
I'm [G]no one's sone. call me young [D5]gun
{eoc}

You ask about my conscience  and I offer you my soul
You ask if I'll grow to be a wise man well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come and I've seen it shot down, I've seen it die in vain

Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first but I drew first blood
I'm the devil’s son, call me young gun

Each night I go to bed I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No I ain't looking for forgiveness, but before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I got to ask a favor and hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest, let this boy  die like a man
Staring down a bullet let me make my final stand

Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first but I drew first blood
I'm no one's son,
call me young gun  I’m a young gun   yeaheah
young gun  yeah yeah yeah yeah  young gun
