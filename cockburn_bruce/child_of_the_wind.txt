{title: Child Of The Wind}
{artist: Bruce Cockburn}

[C]I love the pounding of hooves
I love engines that roar
I [Am]love the wild music of [C]waves on the shore
And the [Am]spiral [C]perfection of a [G]hawk when it [F]soars
[C]I love my sweet woman [Am] down to the core

There's roads and there's roads
And they call, can't you hear it?
Roads of the earth and roads of the spirit
The best roads of all are the ones that aren't certain
One of those is where you'll find me
Till they drop the big curtain

{start_of_chorus}
[G]Hear the wind moan
In the bright diamond [Am]sky
These [F]mountains are waiting
[G]Brown-green and dry
I'm too old for the term
But I'll use it [Am]anyway
I'll be a [F]child of the wind
Till the end of my days
{end_of_chorus}

Little round planet
In a big universe
Sometimes it looks blessed
Sometimes it looks cursed
Depends on what you look at obviously
But even more it depends on the way that you see
