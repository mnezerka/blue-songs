{title: Searcher for Nothing}
{subtitle: Svaťa Kotas/Tomáš Vojtek}

Do you think that you could see
Everything I’d like to be
Are you sure that you can tell
Where heaven falls to hell 

Maybe you must find so hard
Things that made your eyes so blind 
Then we should say after all
Well, we are two but God is only one
    
{start_of_chorus}
Mines of love came tearing down 
Meadows and vineyards someone sets on fire
And heaven never bent so down
To save that weary souls against their harm
{end_of_chorus}

Lost and found and once again
Through the ocean snow and land 
Eyes in skies but down on knees
Searcher for nothing in the moonlight breeze

Some day you’ll find me in the bar
With a glass of wine and an amazed smile
We’ll go somewhere through the town
Dance with light beams until we die

{start_of_chorus}
Mines of love came tearing down 
{end_of_chorus}
