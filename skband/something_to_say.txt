{title: Something to Say}
{subtitle: Svaťa Kotas/Tomáš Vojtek}

Once the sun was like gold pieces

But we’re waiting for the rain

Long and soft like hair of a princess
And we need something to say

Like a path climbing up the mountains
We’ll be rising above
For the fun of white-dressed angels
we’ll be laid out in the sky

{start_of_chorus}
Give me your hand follow me
Round this wide land
Open your heart raise your hands
We got the rain
{end_of_chorus}

In the fountains of the ages
Rare as gold-diamond chain
We’ll be born as healing water
Into teardrops of rain

Now the sun is like gold pieces
But we’re waiting for rain
Long and soft like hair of a princess
And we need something to say

And we need something to say…
