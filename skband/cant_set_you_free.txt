{title: Can’t set you free}
{subtitle: Svaťa Kotas/ Jana Doláková}

I don’t need a pair of wings to fly
Right to you ‘cross the mountain high
Though I don’t even know where you are
You can’t hide away from me

I’ll follow your footsteps all day long
I’ll be in your way to keep you strong 
You don’t believe but you’re not wrong
That’s the way my love can be

{start_of_chorus}
Every time you close your eyes
You’ll see my face, you’ll see my smile 
Now I know, yes know I see
I just can’t set you free
{end_of_chorus}

And when you’re trying to sleep at night
You’ll see that you’re too weak to fight
Better hold on ‘till the morning light
Though my face won’t disappear

When the morning breaks it’s time to go
I seems that your car moves too slow
Don’t hide your feelings let them grow
You’re gonna meet me now for real
