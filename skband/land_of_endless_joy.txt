{subtitle: hudba/text: Svaťa Kotas/Tomáš Vojtek}

[G]Forever spring and never [Am]sorrow
I feel in my [D]mind and in my [Em]soul[D]
For all to[G]days and next to[Am]morrows
We’ll walk through the [D]land of endless [G]joy

{soc}
It can [Bm]set me free from my slave [C]bo[D]dy
It can [Em]give me hope before bad [C]fa[D]lls
There is the [G]sun forever [Am]shining
Deep in my [D]land of endless [G]joy
{eoc}

For many last days I felt like in a hollow
Like in a dark room without a door
But now I see and I could follow
Long way to my land of endless joy

Forever spring and never sorrow
I feel in my mind and in my soul
For all todays and next tomorrows
We’ll walk through the land of endless joy
