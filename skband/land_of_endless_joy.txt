{title: Land fo Endless Joy}
{subtitle: hudba/text: Svaťa Kotas/Tomáš Vojtek}

Forever spring and never sorrow
I feel in my mind and in my soul
For all todays and next tomorrows
We’ll walk through the land of endless joy

It can set me free from my slave body
It can give me hope before bad falls
There is the sun forever shining
Deep in my land of endless joy

For many last days I felt like in a hollow
Like in a dark room without a door
But now I see and I could follow
Long way to my land of endless joy

It can set me free from my slave body
It can give me hope before bad falls
There is the sun forever shining
Deep in my land of endless joy

Forever spring and never sorrow
I feel in my mind and in my soul
For all todays and next tomorrows
We’ll walk through the land of endless joy
