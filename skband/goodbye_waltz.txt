{title: Goodbye waltz}
{subtitle: Svaťa Kotas/Marta Dočolomanská}

Run a bullet right through my head
If you think that I am mad
But my love baby will live forever
This are the words you said

Now you’re lyin’ here before me
No sign of life at all
And I found out baby that your love to me
Won’t scare me anymore

{start_of_chorus}
Bye bye goodbye
Excuse me but I just can’t cry
I’ve done what I’ve done
I’ll make a new start
I will be free from now on
{end_of_chorus}

Since the fist we met, I knew that you’re mad
Following me night and day
I had enough, baby, I had to stop you
And it seems to be the only way
