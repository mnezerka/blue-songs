{title: I’ll wish you well}
{subtitle: Svaťa Kotas/Jana Doláková}

You say: "It’s not the end
Only a trip to foreign land
One year then back again"
But I’m sure it will never be the same

{start_of_chorus}
Let’s pour our last glass of wine
I’m not yours and you not mine
I know, though you’re not fair
I’ll wish you well
Wish you well
{end_of_chorus}

Another job, another place
It’s just your never ending race
Now I wish you’d say before
What you are really looking for

Love makes all the people blind
But it takes time the true love to find
There’s just one thing that makes me scared
You’re not the one, so why do I care
