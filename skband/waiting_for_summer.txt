{title: Waiting for summer}
{subtitle: Svaťa Kotas/Jana Doláková}

I set out on my way always finding a good reason
To make some changes in my life
I think I'm getting lost in the city full of strangers
And the loneliness stabs me like a knife

Sitting at the table with the glass of bitter wine
It's not enough to know I'm not the only one
The candle is burning low but it's my flicker of hope
I can't wait to see the snow melt in the sun

I've became a dreamer
Still looking for
Those days of summer
Will they be like before
I know I'm getting older
When I'm thinking of the past
And this night gets even colder
When I wonder how long my happiness will last
