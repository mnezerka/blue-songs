{title: Waiting for summer}
{subtitle: Svaťa Kotas/Jana Doláková}

[G]I set out on my way always [A]finding a good reason
To [G]make some changes in my [D]life
I [G]think I'm getting lost in the [A]city full of strangers
And the [G]loneliness stabs me like a [D]knife

Sitting at the table with the glass of bitter wine
It's not enough to know I'm not the only one
The candle is burning low but it's my flicker of hope
I can't wait to see the snow melt in the sun

[D]I've became a [G]dreamer
[D]Still looking [G]for
[D]Those days of [Em]summer
Will they [Bm]be like be[A]fore
[D]I know I'm getting [G]older
[D]When I'm thinking of the [G]past
[D]And this night gets even [Em]colder
When I [Bm]wonder how long my happiness will [A]last
