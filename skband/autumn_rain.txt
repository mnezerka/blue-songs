{title: Autumn Rain}
{subtitle: hudba/text: Svaťa Kotas/Tomáš Vojtek}

Drops of rain on the window pane
Draw the picture by a wet way
A candle lit bright with a mellow light
Table for two has been laid

Through the window see the shining eyes
And two faces in the darkness
Maybe wind blows embers over night
And fans new fire from the spark

If you kneel down near the window sill
You can see a flash in the sand
A broken part of a broken heart
The yield of treacherous autumn rain
