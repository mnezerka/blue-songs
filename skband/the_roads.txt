{title: The Roads}
{subtitle: hudba/text: Svaťa Kotas/Tomáš Vojtek}

Some roads are made of broken glass
Some roads are made of streams of tears
And greet our footfalls
Some roads have crowns and noble stripes
Some roads have diamonds in their lines
And sleep in pride

Going astray…
Going astray on dusty pathways …
Going away…
Going away from dusty pathways…

Some roads are going through the swamps
Some roads have marble cathedrals
And fervent prayers
Some roads must end and some must start
Some roads arise when all is done
In our new life days
