Capo 3 - Key of Bb

[G]I’m not used runnin’ [Am]after you
[D]But this time I [Em]just think I’m gonna [Bm]do
And swallow my [C]pride[D]

[G]It’s your love I can’t [Am]do without
[D]All I need is [Em]chase away your [Bm]doubts
And make you [C]stay here [D]by my [G]side

{start_of_chorus}
[D]I’m the best one you ever had
Can’t you [Am]see
[D]There ain’t no other lovin’ you like I do
[Em]Put [D]your [C]trust in [D]me
{end_of_chorus}

No I ain’t gonna give it up
No I ain’t gonna throw away my luck
Like I did before

‘Cause I believed somewhere in the end
You will see you will understand who all my love
Yes who all my love was for

{start_of_chorus}
I’m the best one you ever had 2x
{end_of_chorus}
