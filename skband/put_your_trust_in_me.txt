{title: Put Your Trust in me}
{subtitle: Svaťa Kotas/Marta Dočolomanská}

I’m not used runnin’ after you

But this time I just think I’m gonna do

And swallow my pride
It’s your love I can’t do without
All I need is chase away your doubts
And make you stay here by my side

{start_of_chorus}
I’m the best one you ever had
Can’t you see
There ain’t no other lovin’ you like I do
Put your trust in me
{end_of_chorus}

No I ain’t gonna give it up
No I ain’t gonna throw away my luck
Like I did before
‘Cause I believed somewhere in the end
You will see you will understand who all my love
Yes who all my love was for

{start_of_chorus}
I’m the best one you ever had 2x
{end_of_chorus}
