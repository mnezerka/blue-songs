{title: Late Summer}
{subtitle: Svaťa Kotas/Tomáš Vojtek}

You got a bad day. Yes, I can feel it from your eyes 
Everyone has something to pay 
According to his price

It seems like you hang on for a spell been born by your heart
Another round, throw it away 
Its time to make a new start

{start_of_chorus}
Down in the town of thousand lights
Scarred with the lines of streets
Folks are just chasing moths of love
Shuffling along their feet
{end_of_chorus}

I’ve seen a wild horse flying away cruising the midnight sky 
Nothing is worse like staying in pain 
Shut down the gears of time

Look to the mirror hangin’ on the wall you’ll find you’ve grown through the floor
Yes, it’s fairly late, late summer now
The fall is behind the door

{start_of_chorus}
Down in the town I’ve made my way
Passed a millions lights
Folks with their faces washed away
Looking with empty eyes 2x
{end_of_chorus}
