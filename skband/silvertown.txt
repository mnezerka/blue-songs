{title: Silver Town}
{subtitle: hudba/text: Svaťa Kotas/Tomáš Vojtek}

Somewhere behind the walls of sleep
The darkest shadows of our dreams
Where is my real world with its torment
Pleasures, truth and lies

Under a shiny diamond sky
Crystal foam of a waterfall
Behind the gates of blinking eyes
There is my Silver Town

In the haze of the Universe
You can see me when you close your eyes
And the agelong mould of life
Gently sailing on the waves of times

You could feel the pressure of times
Flyin’ above or falling down
With hopeful pride of rising sun
Expanding all around

When verses of poems in rest of pain
Disappear from the chamber of brain
Then night flickered by the stars
Uncovers Silver Town

In the haze of the Universe
You can see me when you close your eyes
And the agelong mould of life
Gently sailing on the waves of times
