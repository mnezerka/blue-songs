{start_of_chorus}
Another [B]day, another dollar
That's what I'm working for to[E]day[B]
Another [B]day, another dollar
Sure can't [F#]buy my blues a[B]way[E][B]
{end_of_chorus}

I'm just trying to make a [B]living
working jobs that I en[E]joy[B]
But it ain't easy finding something
For this [F#]lonesome hearted [B]boy[E][B]

You know my life is like a highway
Just too many roads to take
And though I try to take the right one
It just gets harder every day
