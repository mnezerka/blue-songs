[C][G][F][G][F][G][Am][G]
[F][G][C][F][C][G][C]

[C]Look at the [G]sky baby
[F]What do you [G]see?
[F]Looks like the [G]tears that I [Am]cry[G]
[F]Fallin' [G]down like [C]rain on the [F]ground
[C]Every [G]time you say [C]goodbye

Take a look around now
Why don't you feel
The way that cold wind stings and bites
And your words just are like arrows through my heart
Every time you say goodbye

{start_of_chorus}
There's a [G]restless feeling knocking at my [F]door to[C]day
There's a [G]shadow hanging 'round my [F]garden [C]gate
I [E]read between the lines of words you [Am]can't disguise
Love has [D]gone away, and put these [F]tears [C]in my [G]ey[C]es
