{title: Ill Remember You Love In My Prayers}
{artist: Alison Krauss & Union Station}

[G]When the curtains of night are pinned back by the stars
And the beautiful moon sweeps the [C]sky
[G]Dewdrops from Heaven are kissin' the [F]rose
It's [G]then that my [D]memory [G]flies

Well, upon the wings of a beautiful dove
I'll hasten this message of cheer
And I'll bring you a kiss of affection and say
I'll remember you, love, in my prayers
 
Now the angels of Heaven are guarding the good
As God has ordained them to do
In answer to prayers that I offer to Him
I know there's one waiting for you

Now go where you will upon land or on sea
And I'll share all your sorrows and cares
At night as I kneel by my bedside to pray
I'll remember you, love, in my prayers
 
[G]Well at night as I kneel by my bedside to [F]pray
I'll [G]remember you, [D]love, in my [G]prayers
