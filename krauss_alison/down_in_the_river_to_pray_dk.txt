{title: Down In The River To Pray}

As I went down to the river to pray
Studyin about that good old way
And who shall wear the starry crown
Good Lord show me the way

O sisters let's go down 
Lets go down, come on down
O sisters lets go down
Down in the river to pray

O brothers ...

O fathers ...

O mothers ...

O sinners ...
