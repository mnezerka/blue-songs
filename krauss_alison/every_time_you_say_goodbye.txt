{title: Every Time You Say Goodbye} 

[E][B][A][B][A][B][C#m][B]
[A][B][E][A][E][B][E]

[E]Look at the [B]sky baby
[A]What do you [B]see?
[A]Looks like the [B]tears that I [C#m]cry[B]
[A]Fallin' [B]down like [E]rain on the [A]ground
[E]Every [B]time you say [E]goodbye

Take a look around now
Why don't you feel
The way that cold wind stings and bites
And your words just are like arrows through my heart
Every time you say goodbye

{start_of_chorus}
There's a [B]restless feeling knocking at my [A]door to[E]day
There's a [B]shadow hanging 'round my [A]garden [E]gate
I [G#]read between the lines of words you [C#m]can't disguise
Love has [F#]gone away, and put these [A]tears [E]in my [B]ey[E]es
