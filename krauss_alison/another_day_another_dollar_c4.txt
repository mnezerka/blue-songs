Another [G]day, another dollar
That's what I'm working for to[C]day[G]
Another [G]day, another dollar
Sure can't [D]buy my blues a[G]way[C][G]
{end_of_chorus}

I'm just trying to make a [G]living
working jobs that I en[C]joy[G]
But it ain't easy finding something
For this [D]lonesome hearted [G]boy[C][G]

You know my life is like a highway
Just too many roads to take
And though I try to take the right one
It just gets harder every day
