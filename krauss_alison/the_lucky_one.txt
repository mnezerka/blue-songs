{title: The Lucky One} 

[Bb][F][Gm][Eb][Bb][F][Eb][Bb]

[Bb]You're the lucky one so I've been told
[F]Free as the wind blowin down the road
[Bb7(addF)]Loved by many, hated by none
[Eb]I'd say you were lucky cause I know what you've done
[Bb]Not a care in the world not a worry in sight
[F]Everything's going to be all right
Cause you're the [Eb]lucky one [Bb]

You're the lucky one always havin fun
A jack of all trades a master of none
You look at the world with a smiling eye
And laugh at the devil as his train rolls by
Just give you a song and a one-night stand
And you'll be looking at a happy man
Cause you're the lucky one

{start_of_chorus}
Were you [Cm]blessed? I guess
By never [F]knowing which road you're choosing
To you the [Cm]next best thing to playin and [F]winning
Is [D7]playin and [Gm]losin
{end_of_chorus}

You're the lucky one I know that now
Don't ask you why when where or how
You look at the world through your smilineye
And laugh at the devil as his train rolls by
Just give you a song and a one-night stand
And you'll be looking at a happy man
Cause you're the lucky one

You're the lucky one I know that now
Don't ask you why when where or how
No matter where you're at is where you'll be
You can bet your luck won't follow me
Just give you a song and a one-night stand
And you'll be looking at a happy man
Cause you're the lucky one.
