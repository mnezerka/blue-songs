{title: Cats In The Cradle}

[D]A child arrived just the [F]other day
[G]He came to the world in the [D]usual way
But there were planes to catch, [F]bills to pay
[G]He learned to walk while [D]I was away
[C]And he was talking 'fore I knew it and as he grew it say
[F]"I'm gonna be like [D]you, dad,
[F]You know I'm gonna be like [D]you"

{start_of_chorus}
And the [D]cats in the cradle and the [C]silver spoon
[F]Little boy blue and the [G]man on the moon
[D]When you comin' home dad, I [C]don't know when
[F]We'll get together [D]then, son
[F]You know we'll have a good time [D]then

My son turned ten just the other day
He said "Thanks for the ball dad, come on, let's play
Can you teach me to throw?", I said "Not today
I got a lot to do", he said "That's OK"
He walked away with a smile on his face, he said
"I'm gonna be like him, yeah,
you know I'm gonna be like him"

Well he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just have to say
I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while
He shook his head and he said with a smile
What I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys
see you later, can I have them please

I've long since retired, my son moved away
I called him up just the other day
I'd like to see you, if you don't mind
He said: "I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time.
You see, my new job's hassle and the kids got the flu,
but it's sure nice talking to you dad, 
it's been sure nice talking to you."


And as I hung up the phone is occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me!
