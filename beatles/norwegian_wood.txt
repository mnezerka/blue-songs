{title: Norwegian Wood}

[D]I once had a girl or should I say [C]she once [G]had [D]me
[D]She showed me her room isn't it good [C]Norwe[G]gian [D]wood

She [Dm]asked me to stay and she told me to sit any[G]where
So [Dm]I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a [Em7]chair[A7]

I sat on a rug biding my time drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said it's time for bed

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone this bird had flown
So I lit a fire isn't it good Norwegian wood
