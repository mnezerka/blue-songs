Intro

[D]I’ve been up and down and round and round and [A]back again
[G]Been so many places I can’t remember where or [A]when
And my [D]only boss was the clock on the wall and my [A]only friend
[G]Never really [A]was a friend at [D]all

{soc}
I’ve [Bm]traded love for pennies, [F#m]sold my soul for less
Lost my i[G]deals in that [D]long tunnel of [A]time
And I’ve turned [D]inside out and around about and [A]back and then
[G]Found myself [A]right back where I[G] star[A]ted a[D]gain.
{eoc}

Once [D]I had myself a million now I’ve [A]only got a dime
[G]Difference don’t seem [A]quite as bad to[D]day
With a [D]nickel or a million I was [A]searchin’ all the time
[G]Something that I'd [A]never lost or [G]left be[D]hind

{chorus}

And now I’m in my second circle and I’m headin’ for the top
I’ve learned a lot of things along the way
I’ll be careful while I’m climbin' cause it hurts a lot to drop
When you’re down nobody gives a damn anyway
