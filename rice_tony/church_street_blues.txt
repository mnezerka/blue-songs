[C]Well I been a-hangin' [F]out of town, Lord, [Am]in that [G]low down [C]rain
Watchin' good-time-[F]Charlie friends is a-[Am]drivin' [G]me insa[C]ne
Up on shady [F]Charlotte Street, Lord, the [Am]green [G]lights look [C]red
I wish I was back home [F]on the farm, Lord, [Am]in my [G]feather [C]bed

{start_of_chorus}
And got my[F]self a rockin' [Am]chair
To [G]see if I could [C]lose
These [F]thin-[Em]dime [Am]hard-[G]time
[F]Hell-on-[G]Church-Street [C]blues

I found myself a picker-friend`s read yesterday's news
I folded up page twenty-one and stuck it in my shoes
I gave me a nickle to the poor my good turn for the day
I folded up my old billfold and threw it far away.

Well I wish I had some guitar strings old Black Diamond brand
I`d string up this old Martin box and go and join some band
But I guess I'm gonna stay right here and pick and sing awhile
Try to make me a little change and give them folks a smile.
