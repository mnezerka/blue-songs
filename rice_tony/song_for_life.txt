{title: Song For Life}
{artist: Tony Rice}

[D A Bm D7 G A7 D A]

I [D]dont drink as [A]much as I [Bm]used to[D7]
Yeah [G]lately it [A7]just aint my [D]style[A]
And [D]hard times dont [A]last like they [Bm]used to[D7]
They pass [G]quicker like [A7]when I was a [D]child

{soc}
[G]And somehow I've l[A7]earned how to [D]listen
To a [G]sound like the [A7]sun goin [Bm]down[D7]
And the [G]magic the [A7]mornin is [D]bringin [G]home
A [D]song for a [A]life I have [Bm]found[D7]
[G]It keeps my [A7]feet on the [D]ground
{eoc}

[D A Bm D7 G A7 D A]
 
The midsummer days sit so heavy
But dont they blow like a breeze through your mind
When nothin appears in a hurry
To make up for someones lost time
 
Chorus
