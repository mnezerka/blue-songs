{title: Best Buy}

[A]You can buy me the best, say you love me like the rest,
But don't think I'm gonna buy the words [E]you say.
[E]You can tell me your sweet lies, with those pretty big blue eyes,
But don't think I'm gonna give my heart [A]away. [E?]

[A]You can tell me things untrue, say you want me like you do,
That you'll [A7]always be the one that's by my [D]side,
But I won't buy it, I'll [D7]deny it, cause I [A]know it isn't [F#]true,
Cause a [D]million times I've [E]heard these lies from [A]you.

[A]That you're gonna give your all and do your best,
Make me the happiest [E]girl that's ever known a love so true.
[E]Tell me that you love'd me so, and you will never let me go,
But [F#]I know it [D]isn't so.[E]

[A]Cause the best that you can buy, don't you think it's gonna fly,
Fly over like the [A7]lies I bought be[D]fore,
Cause you can take your ]stuff, I've [D7]had enough, I'll [A]even hold the [F#]door,
Cause I [D]ain't gonna [E]buy it [A]anymore.
