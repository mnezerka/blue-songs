[Em]Road trippin' with my two [C]favorite [H]allies
Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies
It's time to leave this town, It's time to steal away
Let's go get lost anywhere in the USA
Let's go get lost, let's go get lost

Blue you sit so pretty, west of the one
Sparkles light with yellow icing, just a mirror for the
Sun, just a mirror for the
Sun, just a mirror for the [Am]sun[Hm  C  G]
[Am]These Smiling [Hm]eyes are just a [C]mirror for[G]

So much as come before those battles lost and won
This life is shining more forever in the sun
Now let us check our heads and let us check the surf
Staying high and dry's more trouble than it's worth
In the sun, just a mirror for the
Sun, just a mirror for the sun
These Smiling eyes are just a mirror for

In Big Sur we take some time to linger on
We three hunky dory's got our snakefinger on
Now let us drink the stars, it's time to steal away
Let's go get lost right here in the USA
Let's go get lost, let's go get lost

Blue you sit so pretty, west of the one
Sparkles light with yellow icing, just a mirror for the
Sun, just a mirror for the
Sun, just a mirror for the sun

These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
Your smiling eyes are just a mirror for
