{title: High Lonesome Sound}
{artist: Vince Gill (High Lonesome Sound)}

[G]Whenever my [C]soul is [G]lonely
[C]whenever I'm feelin' [G]blue
I start thinkin' 'bout my [C]blue eyed [G]darlin'
and my [F]heart starts [C]pinin' for [G]you

{soc}
[G]I wanna hear that [C]high lonesome [G]sound
'cause my [C]sweet baby ain't a[G]round
when my [C]life's got me [G]down
I wanna hear that [F]high [C]lonesome [G]sound
{eoc}

When I'm lost in this ocean of darkness
not knowin' which way I should turn
and my eyes are filled with the sadness
of knowin' you'll never return
