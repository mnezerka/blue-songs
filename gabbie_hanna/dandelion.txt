[Em G Cmaj7 B7]

[Em]When I was a little girl, my [G]mama said to me
[Cmaj7]What's your favorite flower, darling? [B7]I'll get you the seed.
I said [Em]Dandelion, Dandelion, [G]that one’s so pretty
She said, [Cmaj7]Child, that one's not a flower, [B7]that one's just a [Em]weed.

[Cmaj7]Oh, what a shame
[B7]Now it don't look the same
[Cmaj7]Guess it don't look the same
[B7]Oh, what a shame

{soc}
[Em]Call me [Cmaj7]what you wan[B7]t (Dandelion, Dandelion)
[Em]You can't [Cmaj7]stop me mult[B7]iplyin’
[Em]Pull me [Cmaj7]from the dirt[B7] (Dandelion, Dandelion)
[Em]No you don't want me [Cmaj7]in your garden, [B7]Dandelion, Dandelion
[Em]Ooh-[Cmaj7]ooh-[B7]ooh, Dandelion, Dandelion
(Dandelion, Dandelion)
{eoc}

I still love those mellow yellow petals anyway
What's that thing they say about a rose by any other name?
Then my fragile flower turned into a ball of grey
So I took a breath and made a wish and blew them all away

Oh, what a shame
Now it don't look the same
Guess it don't look the same
Oh, what a shame

{soc}
Call me what you want (Dandelion, Dandelion)
You can't stop me multiplyin’
Pull me from the dirt (Dandelion, Dandelion)
No you don't want me in your garden, Dandelion, Dandelion
{eoc}

{soc}
Call me what you want (Dandelion, Dandelion)
You can't stop me multiplyin’
Pull me from the dirt
(Dandelion, Dandelion)
No you don't want me in your garden, Dandelion, Dandelion
