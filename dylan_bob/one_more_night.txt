{title: One More Night}

[G]One more night, the stars are in sight
But tonight I'm as [C]lonesome [D]as can [G]be
Oh, the [C]moon is shinin' [G]bright
Lighting [Am]everything in [D]sight
But to[G]night no [C]light will [D]shine on [G]me

Oh, it's shameful and it's sad
I lost the only pal I had
I just could not be what she wanted me to be
I will turn my head up high
To that dark and rolling sky
But tonight no light will shine on me

[G  Am  Em]

[D]I was so mis[C]taken when I [G]thought that she'd be [Ami]true
[G]I had no i[Hm]dea what a [C]woman in love would [D]do

One more night, I will wait for the light
While the wind blows high above the tree
Oh, I miss my darling so
I didn't mean to see her go
But tonight no light will shine on me

One more night, the moon is shinin' bright
And the wind blows high above the tree
Oh, I miss that woman so
I didn't mean to see her go
But tonight no light will shine on me
