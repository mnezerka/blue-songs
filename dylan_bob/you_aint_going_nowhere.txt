[G]Clouds so swift, the [Am]rain fallin' in, [C]gonna see a movie called [G]Gunga Din.
Pack up your money, put up [Am]your tent McGuinn, [C]you ain't a-goin' no[G]where.

Ooo-ee!  Ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come.
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly, down into the easy chair.

Genghis Khan and his brother Don, could not keep on keepin' on.
We'll climb that bridge after it's gone.  After we're way past it.

Buy me some rings and a gun that sings.  A flute that toots and a bee that stings.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
