{title: One More For The Road}
{artist: Josh Shilling}

Over easy In a diner at 3 AM.
I waited out the rain
But this heartache won't end.
Coffee black.  Cigarrettes.
Maam before I go
{How about) Pour me one more for the road.

I see you in a picture
I hear you on the line
Baby as I watch the miles and years go by.
If I could only hold you again you'd know
Baby Once more for the road.

One more day
And I believe I'd get it right.
A lot less runnin'
And a little sleep at night.
One more day
To say that I apologize
For every seed of trouble
That I've sown
If I could have just one more for the road.
One more for the road.

Smoky old bar room
In some old one horse town
When I was a younger man
We used to burn em' down
With no shoulder I can cry when I'm drinkin' all alone
Pour me one more for the road.

I've been way up and way down
Been right but mostly wrong.
Once upon a time I had it all
but now it's gone
I know that there are those who were prayin' for my soul.
Send me up one for the road
One more for The road.
