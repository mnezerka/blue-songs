[C   Am   Em   F   G   C   Am   Em   C  G]

[C]I hope you find the feet  of a dancer, I hope you can  [F] sing  [Am]in the  [Dm]rain
I hope you find [E]all the easy [Am]answers to your [F]pain[G]

It won't be [C]easy, but what can I[Am] say
There will be [F]trouble [G]on the [C] way[G]
And a [C]round every corner, there'll be [Am]terror and tears
But always re[F]member [G]that we're [C]here.

I hope you find the feet  of a dancer, I hope you can sing in the rain
I hope you find  all the easy answers to your pain
I hope you find  love and affection, some one who cares
I hope you find  all the right direction every where.
Every where

Solo:

A shoulder to cry on whenever you're alone
You can rely on us you know
Nothing too crazy, nothing too dear
Always remember that we're here.

I hope you find the feet  of a dancer, I hope you can sing in the rain
I hope you find  all the easy answers to your pain
I hope you find  love and affection, some one who cares
I hope you find  all the right direction every where.
Every where

Bridge: [E]Sometimes when the rain comes [Am]falling down
You know it's falling [D7]down on y[G]ou

I hope you find the feet  of a dancer, I hope you can sing in the rain
I hope you find  all the easy answers to your pain
I hope you find  love and affection, some one who cares
I hope you find  all the right direction every where.
Every where

[Am]Every where, always re[F]member [G]that we're [C]here.

[C   Am   Em   F   G   C   Am   Em   C  G]
