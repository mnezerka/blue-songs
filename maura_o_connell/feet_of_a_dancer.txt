[C][Am][C][F][G][C][Am][Em][C][G]

[G]I hope you find the [C]feet of a dancer,
I hope you can [F]sing [A7]in the [Dm]rain
I hope you find  [E] all the easy [Am]answers [G]to your [F]pain[G]

It won't be [C]easy, but what can I [Am]say
There will be  [F]trouble  [G]along the [C]way[F][G]
Round every [C]corner, there's terror and [Am]tears
Always re[F]member [G]that we're [C]here[G].

I hope you find the feet of a dancer
I hope you can sing in the rain
I hope you find all the easy answers to your pain
I hope you find love and affection
I hope you find someone who cares
I hope you find all the right directions everywhere
Everywhere

[E7]Even when the rain comes [Am]falling down
When it's [F]falling down on [G]you

[C][Am][C][F][G][C][Am][Em][C][G]
