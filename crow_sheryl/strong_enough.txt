[G  C  Em  D]

[G]God I feel like [C]hell to[Em]night [D]
[G]Tears of rage I [C]cannot [Em]fight [D]
I'd be the [G]last to help you [C]under[Em]stand [D]
Are you [G]strong enough to [C]be my [Em]girl? [D]
My [G]girl [C][Em][D]

[G  C  Em  D]

Nothing's true and nothing's right
So let me be alone tonight
Cause you can't change the way I am
Are you strong enough to be my girl?

[Am]Lie[G] to [C]me [D]
I [Em]promise [F]I'll be[C]lieve [D]
[Am]Lie[G] to [C]me [D]
but [Em]please [F]don't [C]leave [D]
[G][C][Em]Don't leave [D]

[G  C  Em  D]

I have a face I cannot show
I make the rules up as I go
It's try and love me if you can
Are you strong enough to be my girl?
My girl

[G  C  Em  D]

Are you strong enough to be my girl?
Are you strong enough to be my girl?
Are you strong enough to be my girl?

When I've shown you that I just don't care
When I'm throwing punches in the air
When I'm broken down and I can't stand
Will you be man enough to be my girl?

Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me but please don't leave

[G]
