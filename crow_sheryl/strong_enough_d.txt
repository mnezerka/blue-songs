[D  G  Hm  A]

[D]God I feel like [G]hell to[Hm]night [A]
[D]Tears of rage I [G]cannot [Hm]fight [A]
I'd be the [D]last to help you [G]under[Hm]stand [A]
Are you [D]strong enough to [G]be my [Hm]man? [A]
My [D]man [G][Hm][A]

[D  G  Hm  A]

Nothing's true and nothing's right
So let me be alone tonight
Cause you can't change the way I am
Are you strong enough to be my man?

[Em]Lie[D] to [G]me [A]
I [Hm]promise [C]I'll be[G]lieve [A]
[Em]Lie[D] to [G]me [A]
but [Hm]please [C]don't [G]leave [A]
[D][G][Hm]Don't leave [A]

[D  G  Hm  A]

I have a face I cannot show
I make the rules up as I go
It's try and love me if you can
Are you strong enough to be my man?
My man

[D  G  Hm  A]

Are you strong enough to be my man?
Are you strong enough to be my man?
Are you strong enough to be my man?

When I've shown you that I just don't care
When I'm throwing punches in the air
When I'm broken down and I can't stand
Will you be man enough to be my man ?

Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me but please don't leave
