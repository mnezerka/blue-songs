{title: What Can I Say}
{subtitle: Brandi Carlile, original in D (capo2)}

[G]Look to the [C]clock on the [F]wall
Hands hardly [C]moving at [G]all
Can't stand the [C]state that I'm [F]in
Sometimes it [C]feels like the [G]walls closing [Am]in

{start_of_chorus}
[F]Oh [C]lord [G]what can I [Am]say
[F]I am so [C]sad since [G]you went [Am]away
[F]Time [C]time [G]ticking on [Am]me
[F]Alone is the [C]last place I [G]wanted to [Am]be
[F]Lord [G]what can I [C]say
{end_of_chorus}

Try to burn my toubles away
drowns my sorrow the same way
seems that no matter how hard I try
It feels like there's something just missing inside

[F]Lord [G]what can I [Am]say
[F]Oh lord [G]what can I [C]say

How many rules can I break
how many lies can I make
how many roads must I turn
to find me a place where the bridge hasn't burned
