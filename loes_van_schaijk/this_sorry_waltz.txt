{title: This sorry waltz}
{subtitle: Loes van Schaijk}

[G]I promised you a waltz but I [C]could not close the [G]deal
[C]Because words could not do [G]justice just to [A7]how you made me [D]feel
[G]And now that I threw that away these words [C]keep ringing in my [A7]ear
You were the [C]light of my [D]life, my dearest [C]dear[G]

{soc}
[C]All I ever really [D]seem to say is [G]"sorry"
[C]But what does "sorry" really [D]do to ease your [G]pain?
So take this [Em]waltz, and take my [D]tears,
Walk [G]away and find yourself a [C]new dear
And if you [Am]ever need me, I'll be [D]here
My dearest [C]dear[G]
{eoc}

Now if you happen to find a match who lights a fire in your soul
Rest assured she'll be inspected by the one who lost it all
And if she ever does you harm, this I promise you
This song will become a murder ballad too

I've been told I'm self-destructive, and if it's true, then it's a curse
Because there's always collateral damage and that only makes it worse
Cause I can't stand to watch you suffer but I want to keep you near
You kept me safe, but now it's time to save you, dear
