{title: Roses In The Snow}
{artist: by Emmylou Harris, written by Ruth Franks}

[G]I met my darling in the [C]springtime
When [G]all the flowers were in [D7]bloom
And l[G]ike the flowers our love [C]blossomed
We [G]married [D7]in the month of [G]June

{start_of_chorus}
Our [C]love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as a golden glow
[G]We had sunshine in December
And [D7]threw our roses in the [G]snow
{end_of_chorus}

Now God  had taken my darling
And left me with a memory
A memory I will always cherish
Are these last words he said to me

My darling's buried on the hillside
Where all the wild spring flowers grow
And when winter snows start falling
On his grave I'll place a rose
