{start_of_chorus}
[D]Round round
Wanna go [D]round
Wanna see the Rock of [C]Ages
[D]When [C]my [D]body gives out
Gonna read the [C]final [D]pages
{end_of_chorus}

Oh my mother is gone
She told me I should meet her
Some day streets of gold
Gonna guide me on
To greet her

Once my father sat down
And told me of the prophets
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
They're gone but not forgotten

Moses heard a voice
It called him up the mountain
Forty days had set
When Moses come a-shouting
