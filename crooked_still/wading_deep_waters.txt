I am wading deep waters trying to get home
Lord I am wading deep waters trying to get home
I am wading deep waters
Wading deep waters
Wading deep waters trying to get home

I am climbing high mountains trying to get home
Lord I am climbing high mountains trying to get home
Lore I am climbing high mountains
Climbing high mountains
Climbing high mounts trying to get home

Lord I am walking deep valleys trying to get home
Lord I am walking deep valleys trying to get home
Wading deep valleys
I am walking deep valleys trying to get home

I am wading deep waters trying to get home
Lord I am wading deep waters trying to get home
Lord I am wading deep waters
Wading deep waters
Wading deep waters trying to get home
