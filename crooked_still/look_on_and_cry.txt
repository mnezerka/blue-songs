{title: Look On and Cry}
{subtitle: Crooked Still}

My dearest friend it's fair you well
You slighted me but i wish you well
If never know more your face i'll see
I'd never serve you like you served me

You caused me to weep you caused me to mourn
If you're satisfied I never could be
To save my cheeks and tears for me
Oh can't you shed one tear for me?

My dearest friend my harmless dove
I hope to meet you in the world above
And when we meet in peace we'll be
My dearest friend remember me

And when i'm dead and layed to rest
Remember one who loved you best
And when you pass by where I lie
Look on my grave look on and cry

And now we've layed her down to rest
Beside the one that loved her best
And when we pass by where she lies
You'll sing the song look on and cry

Remember friends as you pass by
As you all are so once was i
As i am here to be
So get prepared and follow me x2
