[D]Cheeks as red as a [G]bloomin' rose
Eyes of the prettiest [C]brown
She's the darling [G]of my heart
Stay till the sun goes [D]down

{start_of_chorus}
Shady Grove my little love
Shady Grove my darling
Shady Grove my little love
I'm going back to Harlan

First time I saw Shady Grove
She was standing in the door
Shoes and stockings in her hands
And her little feet on the floor

Every night when I go home 
My wife would try to please her
The more I try the worse she gets
I'll be damned if I don't leave her

I wished I had a big fat horse
And corn to feed him on and
A pretty little girl to stay at home
Feed him when I'm gone

Wished I had a banjo string
Made of golden twine
And every time I'd play on it
Wish that girl was mine

Peaches in the summertime
Apples in the fall
If I can't have the one I love
I won't have none at allm
