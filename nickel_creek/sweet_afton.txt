{title: Sweet Afton}

Flow [E]gently, sweet [B]Afton, a[A]mong thy green [E]braes,
Flow [C#m]gently, I'll s[B]ing thee a [A]song in thy [E]praise;
My [E]Mary's a[B]sleep by thy [A]murmuring [E]stream,
Flow [C#m]gently, sweet [B]Afton, di[A]sturb not her [E]dream.

Thou stock dove whose echo resounds thro' the glen,
Ye wild whistly blackbirds in yon thorny den,
Thou green crested lapwing, thy screaming forbear,
I charge you, disturb not my slumbering fair.

How [C#m]lofty, sweet [B]Afton, thy [A]neighboring [E]hills,
Far [F#m]mark'd with the courses of [A]clear winding [B]rills;
There [G#m]daily I [A]wander as [G#]noon rises [C#m]high,[B] oo[A]oh,[E]
My f[F#m]locks and my Mary's sweet [A]cot in my [B]eye.

How pleasant thy banks and green valleys below, 
Where, wild in the woodlands, the primroses blow;
There oft, as mild evening sweeps over the lea,
The sweet-scented birk shades my Mary and me.

Thy crystal stream, Afton, how lovely it glides,
And winds by the cot where my Mary resides;
How wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave,
As, gathering sweet flowerets, she stems thy clear wave.

Flow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes,
Flow gently, sweet river, the theme of my lays; 
My Mary's asleep by thy murmuring stream,
Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dreams.
