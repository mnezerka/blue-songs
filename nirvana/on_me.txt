{title: Oh Me}

If I had to lose a [E]mile
If I had to touch fe[D]elings
I would lose my s[C]oul
The way I [E]do

I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
But that's old news.

Would you like to hear my voice
Sprinkled with emotion
Invented at your birth?

I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse I cannot see
I formulate infinity
and store it deep inside of me

Rep. first 3 verses

I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse I cannot see

I formulate infinity
and store it deep inside of me
