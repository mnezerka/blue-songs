{start_of_chorus}
[G5]Where do bad folks go [F5]when they [Bb5]die?
[G5]They don't go to heaven where the [C5]angels [Bb5]fly
[Gb]They go to the lake of [F5]fire and [Bb5]fry
[C5]Won't see them again 'till the [F5]fourth of Ju[G5]ly
{end_of_chorus}

[Dm]I knew a lady who [Bb/F]came from Duluth
She got [D5]bit [Dm]by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a [Bb/F]little too soon
And she [C5/G]flew away howling on the [D5/A]yellow [Dm]moon

Now the people cry and the people moan
And they look for a dry place to call their home
And try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make them their own
