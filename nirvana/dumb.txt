[E]I'm [A]not like th[G]em, but [C]I can pre[E]tend
[A]The sun is go[G]ne, but [C]I have a [E]light
[A]The day is do[G]ne, but [C]I'm having [E]fun
[A]I think I'm du[G]mb, or [C]maybe just [E]happy
[G]Think I'm just [E]happy (x3)

My heart is broke, but I have some glue
Help me inhale, and mend it with you
We'll float around, and hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down, and have a hangover ...
Have a hangover (x3)

[B7]Skin the [C]sun Fall asleep
[B7]Wish away [C]The soul is cheap
[B7]Lesson learned [C]Wish me luck
[B7]Soothe the burn [C]Wake me up

I'm not like them, but I can pretend
The sun is gone, but I have a light
The day is done, but I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb
Think I'm just happy (x4)
I think I'm dumb (x12)
