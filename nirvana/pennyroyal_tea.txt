[Am]I'm on my time with [G]everyone
[Am]I have very bad [G]posture

[G]Sit and [A]drink Pennyroyal [A#]Tea
[G]Distill the [A]life that's inside of [A#]me
[G]Sit and drink [A]Pennyroyal [A#]Tea
[G]I'm an[A]emic royal[A#]ty

Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally

I'm so tired I can't sleep
I'm a liar and a thief
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty

I'm on warm milk and laxatives
Cherry-flavored antacids

Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty
