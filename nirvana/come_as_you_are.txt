{title: Come As You Are}

Come as you are, as you were,
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend, as an old enemy.
Take your time, hurry up
The choice is yours, don't be late.
Take a rest, as a friend, as an old memoria
Memoria (x3)

Come dowsed in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend, as an old memoria
Memoria (x3)

And I swear that I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun (x2)

Memoria (x4)

And I swear that I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun (x5)

Memoria
