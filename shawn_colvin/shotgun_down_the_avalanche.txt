[Am]I'm riding shotgun down the [D]aval[G/D]anch[D]e  [G/D]Hmmmm[Am]mm
[Am]Tumbling and falling down the [D]ava[G/D]lanche   [G/D]Hmmmmmm[Am]mm

{soc}
So be [F]quiet [G]tonight the [C]stars [C/B]shine [D]bright
On this [F]mountain of [G]new fallen [D]sn[Dsus4]ow[D]
But I will [F]raise up my [G]voice [C]into [C/B]the [D]void
[F]You have left me [Em]nowhere to [Am]go
{eoc}

I love you so much and it's so bizzare
A mystery that goes on and on and on
It is the best thing and the very most hard
And we don't get along

{soc}
And after countless appeals, we keep spinning our wheels
On this mountain of new fallen snow
So I let go the catch and we're over the edge
You have left me nowhere to go
{eoc}

I'm riding shotgun down the avalanche

(guitar interlude: ver + ref)

Sometimes you make me loose my will to live
And just become a beacon for your soul
But the past is stronger than my will to forgive
Forgive you or myself, I don't know

I'm riding shotgun down the avalanche  Hmmmmmm
Tumblin' and fallin' down the avalanche Hmmmmmmmm

{soc}
So be quiet tonight, be sure to step lightly
On this mountain of new fallen snow
But I will raise up my voice into the void
You have left me nowhere to go
{eoc}

I'm riding shotgun down the avalanche  Hmmmmmm

(guitar ending: heavy strumming on D/E chord, then single slow strum on D* chord)
