[Am  G  C  C]

Sun[G]rise, sun[Am]rise
Looks like [G]mornin' in your [C]eyes
But the [Am]clocks held 9:[F]15 for [C]hours
Sun[Em]rise, sun[Am]rise
Couldn't [G]tempt us if it [C]tried
'Cause the [Am]afternoon's al[F]ready come and [C]gone

And I said [Am]hoo[G  C  F]
[Am  G  C  F]
[Am  G  C  F]
To [Dm]you

Surprise, surprise
Couldn't find it in your eyes
But I'm sure it's written all over my face
Surprise, surprise
Never something I could hide
When I see we made it through another day




And I said hoo
To you 

[G  Am  G  C  Am  F  C]
[Em  Am  G  C  Am  F  C  D]

Now good [F]night
Throw its cover [D]down
Ooh on [F]me again [D]
Ooh and if I'm [F]right
It's the [D]only way
To [F]bring me back

[Am]Hoo[G  C  F]
[Am  G  C  F]
[Am  G  C  F]
To [Dm]you

Hoo
To you [C]
